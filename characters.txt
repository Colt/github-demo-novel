Jay Catsby - a young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections. Originally from North Dakota. During World War I, when he was a young military officer stationed at the United States Army's Camp Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, he encountered the love of his life, the beautiful debutante Daisy Buchanan.  He has one goal in life: to reunite with his true love Daisy Buchanan. He is fixated on repeating the past and winning back her love.  

Nick Carraway - Our narrator and guide throughout the story. He's a Yale University graduate from the Midwest, a World War I veteran, and a newly arrived resident of West Egg. Age 29.  He is Catsby's next-door neighbor and a bond salesman. He is easy-going, occasionally sarcastic, and somewhat optimistic.

Daisy Buchanan - a beautiful woman from Louisville, Kentucky, who was once in love with Catsby. After promising to wait for Catsby until the end of the war, she went on to marry Tom Buchanan.

Myrtle Wilson

George Wilson
Myrtle’s husband, the lifeless, exhausted owner of a run-down auto shop at the edge of the valley of ashes. George loves and idealizes Myrtle, and is devastated by her affair with Tom. George is consumed with grief when Myrtle is killed. George is comparable to Gatsby in that both are dreamers and both are ruined by their unrequited love for women who love Tom.
